## Specification

- A background image can be applied to the canvas.
- An image can be saved with or without the background image.
- Quadrilaterals, ellipses, text, and lines can be drawn. When they are clicked off, they are "set".
- Actions can be undone and redone infinitely.
- Out of the box, the editor works with touch gestures.
- Optionally, those with drawing tablets may enable pressure sensitive drawing.
- Out of the box, the editor conforms to any canvas size.
- Image can be zoomed, pinched, and 
- Filters may be applied and de-applied from the image.

## How does it work?

The canvas size and image size are not the same thing. Canvas size is always the same: it is the "working
area." However, the image size can be much smaller than the canvas, fit the canvas (the entire image is
shown), expand horizontally to fill the canvas, and so on.

This is quite similar to how you would open an image on a mobile device and should be quite intuitive to
use on both mobile and personal computer devices.
